// Pure functions produce deterministic, determinable code.

// Function is only pure if given the same input, it produces the same output and it produces no side effects.
// A side effect is a change to the state of the application

// If a function is pure, it operates outside of outside state

// They are good for parallel Processing 

// in math, given x = 1 + ( 2 * 4 )
// 2 * 4 can be replaced with 8 and it has no effect on x or 1

// A referentially transparent method operates like multiply(2,4), 2*4 is replaced with the return value

//
